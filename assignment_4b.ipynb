        "\n",
        "This notebook is hosted on Google Colab. To be able to work on it, you have to create your own copy. Go to *File* and select *Save a copy in Drive*.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can also avoid using Colab entirely, and download the notebook to run it on your own machine. If you choose this, go to *File* and select *Download .ipynb*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The advantage of using Colab is that you can use a GPU. You can complete this assignment with a CPU, but it will take a bit longer. Furthermore, we encourage you to train using the GPU not only for faster training, but also to get experience with this setting. This includes moving models and tensors to the GPU and back. This experience is very valuable because for many interesting models and large datasets (like large CNNs for ImageNet, or Transformer models trained on Wikipedia), training on GPU is the only feasible way.\n",
        "\n",
        "The default Colab runtime does not have a GPU. To change this, go to *Runtime - Change runtime type*, and select *GPU* as the hardware accelerator. The GPU that you get changes according to what resources are available at the time, and its memory can go from a 5GB, to around 18GB if you are lucky. If you are curious, you can run the following in a code cell to check:\n",
        "\n",
        "```sh\n",
        "!nvidia-smi\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that despite the name, Google Colab does  not support collaborative work without issues. When two or more people edit the notebook concurrently, only one version will be saved. You can choose to do group programming with one person sharing the screen with the others, or make multiple copies of the notebook to work concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Submission:** Upload your notebook in .ipynb format to Canvas. The code and answers to the questions in the notebook are sufficient, no separate report is expected. "

        "Only a subset of nodes is revealed to the model as labeled (through train_mask), essentially treating the other nodes as unlabeled. The gradient update is only performed based on the labeled nodes, i.e., in a **supervised** manner, but the connected graph structure (represented by the adjacency matrix) also allows to transmit gradient information from the labeled nodes to the unlabeled nodes. As the representations of the labeled nodes again depend on the representations of the unlabeled nodes, the model is forced to learn \"correct\" representations also of the unlabeled nodes. The model is thus capable to learn representations for unlabeled nodes without explicitly being trained on these nodes; the model thus also partly learns in an **unsupervised** fashion. As the GCN is able to learn both in a supervised and unsupervised way, the GCN is suitable to solve **semi-supervised** classification tasks.\n",

This demonstrates that not even 10% of graph nodes are needed to obtain a meaningful classification of labeled and unlabeled nodes in a GCN. Other commonly used neural network architectures would require a far higher amount of training examples in order to achieve comparable results. \n",

        " The final accuracy obtained in the independent testset unfortunately did not attain a competitive level with a test accuracy of 76,786%. This performance lies above the state of the art from 2016, but below the state of the art from 2019. Based on the tuning using the validation set, we expected a higher performance, at least close to 80%. As evident in the loss plot (see above), the test loss starts to rise after around 1500 epochs, while the training loss keeps decreasing. This is a clear sign for overfitting the model to the training data. Thus, it might be best to train the GCNs for a smaller amount of epochs, in order to avoid overfitting on the training set. However, in order to preserve good scientific practice, we did not try to optimize based on the test accuracy, but rather accept the results as they are. "
